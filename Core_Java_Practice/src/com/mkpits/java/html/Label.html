The <label> Element
The <label> element defines a label for several form elements.

The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the
label when the user focus on the input element.

The <label> element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio
buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the
radio button/checkbox.
