body {
background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
}

If the image above is repeated only horizontally (background-repeat: repeat-x;), the background will look
better:
Example

body {
background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
background-repeat: repeat-x;
}

Tip: To repeat an image vertically, set background-repeat: repeat-y;
CSS background-repeat: no-repeat

Showing the background image only once is also specified by the background-repeat property:
Example

Show the background image only once:
body {
background-image: url("img_tree.png");
background-repeat: no-repeat;
}

In the example above, the background image is placed in the same place as the text. We want to change
the position of the image, so that it does not disturb the text too much.
CSS background-position

The background-position property is used to specify the position of the background image.
Example

Position the background image in the top-right corner:
body {
background-image: url("img_tree.png");
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: right top;
}
