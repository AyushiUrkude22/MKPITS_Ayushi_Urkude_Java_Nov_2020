#### Program 218)BabyDog2ExtendsDog.java
Java program to BabyDog is not overriding the eat() method, so eat() method of Dog class is invoked.

#### Program 219)BabyDogExtendsDog.java
Java Runtime Polymorphism with Multilevel Inheritance.

#### Program 220)Bike.java
Java program Example of Both the classes have a data member speedlimit. We are accessing the
data member by the reference variable of Parent class which refers to the subclass object. Since we are
accessing the data member which is not overridden, hence it will access the data member of the Parent class always.

#### Program 221)MethodOverridingButThereWasNoUpcasting.java
Java program example of Consider a scenario where Bank is a class that provides a method to get the rate of interest. However,
the rate of interest may differ according to banks. For example, SBI, ICICI, and AXIS banks are providing
8.4%, 7.3%, and 9.7% rate of interest.

#### Program 222)RuntimePolymorphism.java
Java program to In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass
The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.

#### Program 223)SubclassMethodInvoked.java
Java program to We are creating two classes Bike and Splendor. Splendor class extends Bike class and
overrides its run() method. We are calling the run method by the reference variable of Parent class.
Since it refers to the subclass object and subclass method overrides the Parent class method, the
subclass method is invoked at runtime.

#### Program 224)TestPolymorphism2.java
Java Runtime Polymorphism Example: Shape.

#### Program 225)TestPolymorphism3.java
Java Runtime Polymorphism Example: Animal.

#### Program 226)Animal.java
Java program to Objects have a type
An object is an instance of particular java class,but it is also an instance of its superclass.

#### Program 227)DynamicBinding.java
Java program Example of dynamic binding.

#### Program 228)ReferencesDog.java
Java program Example of References have a type.

#### Program 229)StaticBindingDog.java
Java program Example of Static Binding.

#### Program 230)NextTokenTest.java
Java program to create Example of nextToken(String delim) method of StringTokenizer class.

#### Program 231)StringTokenizerSimple.java
Java program to the simple example of StringTokenizer class that tokenizes a string "my name is ayushi" on the
basis of whitespace.

#### Program 232)StringTokenizerSimple1.java
Java program to Simple example of StringTokenizer class.

#### Program 233)Animal.java
Java program to Animal and Dog both classes have a common property color. If we print color proprty,
 it will print the color of current class by default. To access the parent property, we need to use super keyword.

#### Program 234)CompilerImplicitlyAnimal.java
Java program to Super keyword where super() is provided by the compiler implicitly.

#### Program 235)InvokeParentClassConstructorAnimal.java
Java program to The super keyword can also be used to invoke the parent class constructor.

#### Program 236)InvokeParentClassMethodAnimal.java
The super keyword can also be used to invoke parent class method. It should be used if subclass
contains the same method as parent class. In other words, it is used if method is overridden.

#### Program 237)ParentClassChildClassHaveSameFieldsAnimal.java
Java Program to We can use super keyword to access the data member or field of parent class. It is used if parent class
and child class have same fields.

#### Program 238)SuperKeywordPerson.java
Java program to class inherits Person class so all the properties of
Person will be inherited to Emp by default. To initialize all the property, we are using parent class
constructor from child class. In such way, we are reusing the parent class constructor.

#### Program 239)CallingParameterizedConstructorFromDefaultConstructor.java
Write a program to Calling parameterized constructor from default constructor.

#### Program 240)DoNotUseThisKeyword.java
Write a program to Understanding the problem without this keyword.

#### Program 241)InvokeCurrentClass.java
Write a program to invoke the method of the current class by using the this keyword. If you don't use the this
keyword, compiler automatically adds this keyword while invoking the method.

#### Program 242)InvokeCurrentClassConstructor.java
The this() constructor call can be used to invoke the current class constructor. It is used to reuse the
constructor.In other words, it is used for constructor chaining.

#### Program 243)KeywordIsNotRequired.java
Write a program to where this keyword is not required.

#### Program 244)PassArgumentInTheMethod.java
Write a program to The this keyword can also be passed as an argument in the method.

#### Program 245)ProvingThisKeyword.java
Write a program to prove that this keyword refers to the current class instance variable. In this program, we are printing
the reference variable and this, output of both variables are same.

#### Program 246)RealUsageOfThisConstructor.java
The this() constructor call should be used to reuse the constructor from the constructor. It maintains the
chain between the constructors i.e. it is used for constructor chaining.

#### Program 247)ReturnCurrentClassInstance.java
Write a program to this keyword that you return as a statement from the method.

#### Program 248)UseThisKeyword.java
Write a program to understand the problem if we use this keyword.

#### Program 249)TryCatchExample.java
Java program to try to understand the problem if we don't use a try-catch block.

#### Program 250)TryCatchExample1.java
Java program to There can be 100 lines of code after exception. So all the code after exception will not be executed.
Solution by exception handling
Let's see the solution of the above problem by a java try-catch block.

#### Program 251)TryCatchExample2.java
In this example, we also kept the code in a try block that will not throw an exception.

#### Program 252)TryCatchExample3.java
Here, we can see that if an exception occurs in the try block, the rest of the block code will not execute.
Here, we handle the exception using the parent class exception.

#### Program 253)TryCatchExample4.java
Let's see an example to print a custom message on exception.

#### Program 254)TryCatchExample5.java
Let's see an example to resolve the exception in a catch block.

#### Program 255)TryCatchExample6.java
In this example, along with try block, we also enclose exception code in a catch block.

#### Program 256)TryCatchExample7.java
In this example, we handle the generated exception (Arithmetic Exception) with a different type of
exception class (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException).

#### Program 257)TryCatchExample8.java
Let's see an example to handle another unchecked exception.

#### Program 258)TryCatchExample9.java
Let's see an example to handle checked exception.
